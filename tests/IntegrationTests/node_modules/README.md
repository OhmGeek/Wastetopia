# Running Tests
## Requirements
In order to run tests, you need to have Selenium Webdriver installed.

```bash
npm install selenium-standalone -g
selenium-standalone install
```

Then start the selenium server:

```bash
selenium-standalone start
```
You also need to install Nightwatch.js, a testing library. You can do this globally,
or just install it by running:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the tests
Tests can be run using the nightwatch command directly (if installed globally).
Otherwise, run:

```bash
./test.sh
```

## Reports
Reports on the tests can be found in XML form in the reports folder.

## Where to put new tests?
Easy! Simply put new tests in the tests/ folder, and they will be run. Simple!
